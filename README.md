  * This is a college project developed with Java and made for desktop.
  * The idea is to control a car renting business, from the beggining, until the end.
  * It conects to an API that controls the cars and its status, like: available or not.
  * Also this APi is mirrored to a local database, allowing it to work with no internet.
  * The API works as a reference for the local storage and also can be used in the web, 
  mobile or other platform.
